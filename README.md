# A Brief Description
The world of SEO is far and wide. RSS feeds from the leading SEO blogs are cool, but keeping track of every new change can be hard. This project will act as a central repository where all the new stuff I learn about SEO will be aggregated.

The stuff that I miss..... Well , I'm hoping you guys will come and fill up for my laziness :)

# Structure
The structure will follow a chronological order, where the timeline of a common SEO Analyst's workflow will be used for guidance. 

For example, `SEO Strategy` comes before `On-Page Optimization`, or `Backlinking` comes before `Measuring Success`, and so on.
