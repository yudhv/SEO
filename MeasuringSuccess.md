# Top KPIs
1. Traffic Share of each Medium 
    * Direct Navigation: Typed in traffic, bookmarks, email links without tracking codes, etc.
    * Referral Traffic: From links across the web or in track-able email, promotional, and branding campaign links
    * Search Traffic: Queries that sent traffic from any major or minor web search engine
2. Traffic Share of each SE
    * Compare volume contribution of each SE with its estimated market share
    * Get Visibility Into Potential Drops - If all the engines drop off traffic equally, the problem is of accessibility. If only Google drops, your SEO efforts are at fault
    * Uncover SE-specific value - ex=>On-Page optimization like better keyword inclusion and targeting reap greater benefits with Bing/Yahoo than with Google, while gaining specific anchor text links from a large number of domains is more valuable to Google
3. Traffic Share of different KWs
    * Identify trends in new possible KWs
    * Find KWs sending you good traffic that pages are under-optimized for 
    * Keep track of KWs outside of the top phrases. In-case top KW trends go down, you know where to focus efforts on for immediate course-correction
4. Conversion Rate of different KWs
    * Find which KWs convert high but your page ranks low for. Try improving rankings
    * Improve on-page experience for the pages connected to these KWs
    * Dig deeper to see how and why conversions happen more on these KWs
5. No. of pages receiving at least 1 SE referral
    * This number gives a glimpse into the indexation of your domain for SEs
    * All On-Page SEO optimizations like site architecture, XML sitemaps, and uniqueness of content and meta data can be measured through increases in this number
    * Note - This number is more helpful to large websites (1000s of pages)
6. Measuring link value
Link-value measuring is important as it tells you how successful your link building campaign was
    * Check ranking of the referring site for your KW set. If it ranks well, it's link is valuable
    * Check your competition's backlinks, and target them in your link-building campaigns
    * Check Domain Authority of your referrers. It is a query-independent measure of the likeliness of a domain to rank well for any arbitrary query
    * Check the amount of traffic being sent by the referrer. High traffic generally means good SE presence
    * The marks of a successful link-building campaign are - 
        * increases in search traffic
        * higher rankings
        * more frequent search engine crawling
        *  increases in referring link traffic


# Actions to Take on KPIs
* Falling search traffic from a single SE
    * Check [this](https://moz.com/blog/how-to-handle-a-google-penalty-and-an-example-from-the-field-of-real-estate) to find out how you got an SE penalty
    * You might've accidentally blocked access to an SE's crawler. Double-check robots.txxt and meta robotss tags, and check the webmaster tools for that SE (eg. Google SEC)
    * That engine has changed their ranking algorithm in a fashion that no longer favors your site. Most frequently, this happens because links pointing to your site have been devalued in some way, and is especially prevalent for sites that engage in manual link building campaigns of low-moderate quality links.
* Falling search traffic from multiple SEs
    * You've blocked crawlers. Check -
        * Meta-Robots tags
        * robots.txt
        * problem with hosting/uptime
        * DNS resolution issue
* Falling search traffic from a KW
    * Only if the fall is dramatic, do -
        * review on-page elements for any signs of over-optimization
        * review any violation of guidelines (cloaking, keyword stuffing, etc.) 
        * check to see if links have recently been gained or lost
    * Note - spikes in rankings for new content, a temporary period of high visibility followed by a dramatic drop is common; we refer to this as the "freshness boost"
* Rising link metrics but NOT rankings
    * For new sites, pages, and content with heavy competition, ranking improvements take time
    * Metrics and rankings you're seeking may be days or even weeks behind the progress you've made
