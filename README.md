# A Brief Description
The world of SEO is far and wide. RSS feeds from the leading SEO blogs are cool, but keeping track of every new change in Google's algo or every new piece of SEO research can be hard. This project will act as a central repository where all the new stuff about SEO will be aggregated.

The stuff that I miss..... Well, I'm hoping you guys will come and fill up for my laziness :)

# Structure
The structure will follow a chronological order, where the timeline of a common SEO Analyst's workflow will be used for guidance. 

A brief description of common SEO techniques will be written, and can be found in the Basics folder.

Most of the updates in SEO will be recorded as links in this repository's root files.
