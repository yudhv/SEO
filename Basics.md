2. Formulate that need in a string of words and phrases, also known as “the query”
3. Enter the query in a search engine
4. Browse through the results for a match
5. Click on a result
6. Scan for a solution, or a link to that solution
7. If unsatisfied, return to the SERP and browse for another link
8. Perform a new search with refinements to the query
