## Step 1 - Understand the big search trends
* SERP features
* Instant Answers
* Search Intent > Keywords
* Multi-Device Speed and UX
* Optimizing for multi-visit buyer's journey
* Bias towards brands (doesn't always mean abundance of backlinks)
* Bias towards BackLink quality

## Step 2 - Map your top-level business goals to your SEO efforts
1. List all business goals
2. For each goal, identify how SEO efforts can help fuel the goal's fruition
3. Example
    | Goal | SEO Effort |
    |---|---|
    | Lower costs to get more profitable | Reducing CPA (Cost per acquisition) |

## Step 3 - Map your KW->Content 
| KW | Rank | URL | Action | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| zow | #2 | zow.com | link building & brand amplification | High |
| woz | #4 | zow.com/woz | Content Rewrite | Medium |

## Step 4 - Map SEO Efforts
* Assign each SEO effort to discrete projects 
* Assign ETAs, and team members to each project
* Give expected ROI to each
    | Project | Priority | Value Estimate | Team Member | ETA |
    |---|---|---|---|---|
    | Homepage link building | #1 | High (why?) | Joe | [Date]|

## Step 5 - Build a reporting system that maps goals to quantitative metrics
