## Step 2 - Map your top-level business goals to your SEO efforts
1. List all business goals
2. For each goal, identify how SEO efforts can help fuel the goal's fruition
3. Example

| zow | #2 | zow.com | link building & brand amplification | High |
| woz | #4 | zow.com/woz | Content Rewrite | Medium |

## Step 4 - Map SEO Efforts
* Assign each SEO effort to discrete projects 
* Assign ETAs, and team members to each project
* Give expected ROI to each
    | Project | Priority | Value Estimate | Team Member | ETA |
    |---|---|---|---|---|
    | Homepage link building | #1 | High (why?) | Joe | [Date]|
