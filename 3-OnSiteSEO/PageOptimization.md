# Keyword Usage
## Summary
* In the title tag at least once. Try to keep the keyword phrase as close to the beginning of the title tag as possible
* Once prominently near the top of the page.
* At least two or three times, including variations, in the body copy on the page. Perhaps a few more times if there's a lot of text content.
* At least once in the alt attribute of an image on the page. This not only helps with web search, but also image search.
* Once in the URL
* At least once in the meta description tag. Note - this does not get used by SEs for rankings, but helps attract clicks on SERP
* Do NOT use keyword in link anchor text pointing to other pages on your site (called keyword cannibalization)

## Title
* Keep length < 65-75 characters as that is what SEs show on SERP
* Place important keywords close to the front
* Try adding branding in the title if possible
* It must be descriptive, readable, compelling and attention-grabbing

## Meta-Tags - <META NAME="ROBOTS" CONTENT="NOINDEX, NOFOLLOW">
* Meta Robots - Used to control search engine crawler activity on a per-page level
    * index/noindex - use if you wanna stop SEs from indexing (default: index)
    * follow/nofollow - use to stop SEs from crawling this page (default: follow)
    * noarchive - use to stop SEs from save a cached copy of this page
    * nosnippet - use to stop SEs from displaying description in SERP
    * noodp/noydir - use to tell SEs to take desc from DMOZ or Yahoo Directory
* Meta Description - Short description of a page's content shown on SERP
    * Very important 
    * SEs cut these after 160 characters, so stay within this limit
    * Do not include this if page targets multiple keywords. In this case the SEs will create the search snippet from other elements on the page. Valid tactic
    * Keep it readable, compelling
    * Include imp keywords as Google bolds them on SERP

## Content
* Provide alt-text for images
* Supplement search boxes with navigation and crawl-able links
* Supplement Java and Flash plug-ins with text on the page
* Provide transcripts for video and audio content
* Use Rich Snippets to allow SEs to add more value to your SERP results, like ratings, dates etc. Check schema.org, google, and mozbar for usage and verification info. 
* Use [Pingomatic](http://pingomatic.com/) to automatically ping Google, Yahoo, Bing whenever you publish new content. This will tell them that your content is original, and copycats will be prohibited
* Use tools like Google Cache, SEO-browser, and MozBar to see what content is indexable by search engines
* Do not let any page become an orphan (without any page linking to it)

## URL
* Use empathy here. Think if it gives a rough description to u as a user
* Shorter is better. It'll be easier to share and copy, and will look good in the top bar
* Use KWs but not too much. If page targets mutliple KWs, then keep the best ones
* Use static URLs - Using technologies like mod_rewrite for Apache and ISAPI_rewrite for Microsoft,  transform dynamic URLs like this https://moz.com/blog?id=123 into a more static version like this: https://moz.com/blog/google-fresh-factor. Even single dynamic parameter in a URL can result in lower overall ranking and indexing
* Use hyphens to separate words - Not all web applications accurately interpret separators like underscores (_), plus signs (+), or spaces (%20), so use hyphens(-)

# How Google measures UI of a site
* Engagement Metrics
    * Google uses Google Analytics data to gauge user-engagement on a website 
    * So, the way visitors engage with your site will affect your rankings
    * Ex - If users go back as soon as they arrive from Google, your site will suffer
* Machine Learning
    1. The Panda update in 2011
    2. Google used human evaluators to manually rate thousands of sites, searching for low quality content
    3. Google then incorporated machine learning to mimic the human evaluators
    4. The end result was a seismic shift that rearranged over 20% of all results
