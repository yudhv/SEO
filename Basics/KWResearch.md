# Assessing a KW's value
1. Ask yourself
    * Is the KW relevant to your website?
    * Will searchers find what they're looking for on your site after they search for this KW?
    * Will they be happy with what they find?
    * Will this traffic convert?
2. Search on an SE
    * Note which websites already rank for this KW
    * Are these websites big (check Similarweb)?
    * Are there search ads on the top and side of the SERP? If yes, the KW is highly lucrative and conversion-prone
3. Buy a sample AdWords campaign for the KW
    * This will tell you how well the traffic will convert for this KW
    * Track impressions and conversion rate for at least 200-300 clicks
4. Determine the exact value of the KW
    * At this point, you have all the data you need except the potential click-through rate for #1 ranking on the KW's SERP (for which [check this](https://moz.com/blog/mission-imposserpble-establishing-clickthrough-rates))
    * Now, you have the impression, click (paid and organic both), and conversion rates
    * ex=>Say, your ad generated 5,000 impressions in one day, of which 100 people clicked and came to your site, of which 3 visitors converted. So CTR (click through rate) is 2%. CVR (conversion rate) is 3%.If you made $100 from the 3 conversions and 100 visitors - 
    **your KW value is $1** 


# Long Tail KWs
![Search Demand](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yudhv/SEO/master/References/longTailKW.png "MozBeginnersGuide")
* Popular search terms only account for 30% of all web searches (FatHead+ChunkyMiddle)
* 70% searches involve long-tail keywords
* Long Tail also converts better as it captures visitors later in the buying/conversion cycle
* It is of 3 types:
    1. Informational - `How to use a smartphone`
    2. Transactional - `Buy LED TV online`
    3. General - `ecommerce wordpress website`
* ex=>A person searching for "shoes" is probably browsing, not buying. Alternatively, someone searching for "best price on Air Jordan size 12" practically has their wallet out!

# Research through Competition
## 1. Find Competitor domains
* First get just one competitor in your genre. 
* Now use its domain to get a list of the top competitors for this domain through the following - 
    * SimilarWeb
    * SpyFu
    * Alexa
    * `related:[competitorDomain]` 

## 2. Filter this list
* Keep the websites that **rank 20,000 to 50,000 globally** (Similarweb). This range is flexible based on the availability of competitors in your niche. Can go upto **500,000** and as low as **5,000**.
* Get >10 competitors on this filtered list
* If competitors are not enough, then go back to step 1

## 3. Find top organic keywords
* Start from the least popular site to the most popular one
* Get a total of 100 KWs
* After **SEMrush** and **SimilarWeb**, other tools offer diminishing returns for the effort. However, if the afore-mentioned tools don't get you enough KWs, then go for the next 2 (**SpyFu** and **Alexa**)
    ### SEMrush 
    * Go to top Organic search KWs (will give 10) 
    * Sort by different columns like Volume, Traffic %, etc to get different lists
    * Prefere KWs with **>10,000** monthly traffic and **<0.30** Competition Value. Both values flexible
    * Skip KWs with declining trends. Their monthly traffic (which is calculated by averages) might seem high, but actually it isn't
    * Skip brand KWs 
    ### SimilarWeb
    * Go to the Search section and note down the top 5 KWs
    ### SpyFU
    * Go to the **SEO keywords** (will give only 5)
    * Prefer KWs with **>5k** monthly traffic and **<30** Ranking Difficulty. Both are flexible
    ### Alexa
    * Go to *Browse Top Sites* and enter the domain
    * Get the 5 KWs you haven't added already from the *top Keywords from Search Engines*
    * The KWs mentioned here are not reliable after the 200,000 Alexa rank

## 4. Keyword Validation
* Add all the top KWs into Google Trends and see which ones have good trends and volume
* Remove KWs with low volume, or reduced trends and replace them with the next set of KWs
* Find the long-tail versions of these broad KWs by checking the *Related queries* boxes for each KW
* Now, you should have 50-60 trending long-tail or breakout low competition KWs
* Use this list to create content and rank on SERP

# Research through KW ideas
Sometimes, we have a little idea about the KWs in our niche. Based on those guesses, we can aggregate a huge list of related KWs. Here the steps for that - 
## UberSuggest
* Most important is the *Keyword Ideas* section
## SeoBook
* To get KW ideas different from UberSuggest. 
* It also gives more the monthly, daily, Google vs Bing traffic, 
## SEMrush
* Helps get the Mobile search metrics as well
## Keywordtool.io 
* Can only be used to get KW ideas
