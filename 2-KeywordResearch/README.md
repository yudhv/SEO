## Assessing a KW's value
1. Ask yourself
    * Is the KW relevant to your website?
    * Will searchers find what they're looking for on your site after they search for this KW?
    * Will they be happy with what they find?
    * Will this traffic convert?
2. Search on an SE
    * Note which websites already rank for this KW
    * Are these websites big (check Similarweb)?
    * Are there search ads on the top and side of the SERP? If yes, the KW is highly lucrative and conversion-prone
3. Buy a sample AdWords campaign for the KW
    * This will tell you how well the traffic will convert for this KW
    * Track impressions and conversion rate for at least 200-300 clicks
4. Determine the exact value of the KW
    * At this point, you have all the data you need except the potential click-through rate for #1 ranking on the KW's SERP (for which check this)
    * Now, you have the impression, click (paid and organic both), and conversion rates
    * ex=>Say, your ad generated 5,000 impressions in one day, of which 100 people clicked and came to your site, of which 3 visitors converted. So CTR (click through rate) is 2%. CVR (conversion rate) is 3%.If you made $100 from the 3 conversions and 100 visitors - **your KW value is $1** 


## Long Tail KWs
* Popular search terms only account for 30% of all web searches (FatHead+ChunkyMiddle)
* 70% searches involve long-tail keywords
* Long Tail also converts better as it captures visitors later in the buying/conversion cycle
* ex=>A person searching for "shoes" is probably browsing, not buying. Alternatively, someone searching for "best price on Air Jordan size 12" practically has their wallet out!
