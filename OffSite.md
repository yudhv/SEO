# Link Characteristics
### 1. Global Popularity 
- The more popular your inbound links, the better
### 2. Topic Popularity 
- Links from sites that belong to the same topic-specific community matter more than links from off-topic sites
### 3. Anchor Text 
- If multiple sites use similar set of KWs to point to your page, then you get ranked well for those KWs
### 4. TrustRank 
- Highly trusted domains like Universities, government sites, and non-profits boost the non-spam metric of your page if you get linked that is.

### 5. Link Neighbourhood 
- Websites linking to spam are likely spam themselves, and in turn often have many spam sites linking back to them. This give SEs a "link neighbourhood" of spam sites. By associating with such neighbourhoods, you'll get compromised
### 6. Freshness 
- Links decay over time. This happens when the referring sites lose popularity. SEs use the freshness of links to judge current popularity and relelvance
### 7. Social Sharing 
- SEs treat socially shared links differently than other link types, but notice them nonetheless. 

# Link Building
Build as vast and varied a link profile as possible, as it brings the best SE results. link building patterns that appear non-standard, unnatural, or manipulative will eventually become a target for advancing search algorithms
## 3 basic link building schemes
### 1. "Natural" Editorial Links
*  Links given naturally (without asking) by sites that WANT to link to you
* Creation of worthy content and creating awareness are imp here
### 2. Manual "Outreach" Link Building 
* The SEO often creates a value proposition by explaining to the link target why creating the link is in their best interest
* Emailing bloggers for links
* Submitting sites to directories
* Paying for listing of any kind
* Filling forms for submissions to website award programs
* Convincing professors to include your resource on public syllabus
### 3. Self-Created, Non-Editorial (Lowest value, borderline spam)
* Creating links on websites that offer linking services through guest book signings, forum signs, blog comments, user profiles, etc
* Aggressive pursuant of this strategy get penalizes by SEs
