## Actions to Take on KPIs
* Falling search traffic from a single SE
    * Check this to find out how you got an SE penalty
    * You might've accidentally blocked access to an SE's crawler. Double-check robots.txxt and meta robotss tags, and check the webmaster tools for that SE (eg. Google SEC)
    * That engine has changed their ranking algorithm in a fashion that no longer favors your site. Most frequently, this happens because links pointing to your site have been devalued in some way, and is especially prevalent for sites that engage in manual link building campaigns of low-moderate quality links.
* Falling search traffic from multiple SEs
    * You've blocked crawlers. Check -
        * Meta-Robots tags
        * robots.txt
        * problem with hosting/uptime
        * DNS resolution issue
* Falling search traffic from a KW
    * Only if the fall is dramatic, do -
        * review on-page elements for any signs of over-optimization
        * review any violation of guidelines (cloaking, keyword stuffing, etc.) 
        * check to see if links have recently been gained or lost
    * Note - spikes in rankings for new content, a temporary period of high visibility followed by a dramatic drop is common; we refer to this as the "freshness boost"
* Rising link metrics but NOT rankings
    * For new sites, pages, and content with heavy competition, ranking improvements take time
    * Metrics and rankings you're seeking may be days or even weeks behind the progress you've made
