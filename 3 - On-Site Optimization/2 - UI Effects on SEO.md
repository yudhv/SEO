## How Google measures UI of a site
* Engagement Metrics
    * Google uses Google Analytics data to gauge user-engagement on a website 
    * So, the way visitors engage with your site will affect your rankings
    * Ex - If users go back as soon as they arrive from Google, your site will suffer
* Machine Learning
    1. The Panda update in 2011
    2. Google used human evaluators to manually rate thousands of sites, searching for low quality content
    3. Google then incorporated machine learning to mimic the human evaluators
    4. The end result was a seismic shift that rearranged over 20% of all results
